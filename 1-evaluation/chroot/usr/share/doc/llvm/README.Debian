		The Debian LLVM Setup
		=====================

Abstract
--------

Debian uses a default version of LLVM for most packages; however, some
packages require another version.  So, Debian allows several versions
of LLVM to coexist on the same system, and selects the default version
by means of the llvm-defaults package, which creates symbolic links as
appropriate.

How are the default compilers selected?
---------------------------------------

Starting in Debian 6.0, there is now a llvm-defaults package set. This
creates the actual packages for llvm, llvm-runtime, llvm-dev and
libllvm-ocaml-dev. These packages will depend on the corresponding
default compiler for that architecture. For example,
"llvm" depends on "llvm-3.0", which means that the "llvm-3.0" package
will install some binaries suffixed by "-3.0", which are symlinked in
the "llvm" package to unversioned binaries.

This may seem confusing, but what it allows you do to is install more
than one version of the Low Level Virtual Machine at the same time,
making sure you are always using the one preferred for that
architecture.

The default compiler versions for Debian GNU/Linux on amd64 are
(minor version numbers omitted):

	llvm		: llvm-11

Thanks to llvm-defaults, each architecture can choose its own
preferred llvm version, and that preference can change without
requiring a complete rebuild of both llvm packages for all
architectures.

How to build with a specific version of clang?
----------------------------------------------

Please give the CC or CXX variables to the build system.
For example, to build with clang-11, the following command should
do the work:

CC=clang-11 CXX=clang++-11 make
or
CC=clang-11 CXX=clang++-11 ./configure

llvm-*/... are not handled using alternatives
----------------------------------------------

The symlinks in /usr/bin (llvm-*, ...) are not handled using the Debian
alternative mechanism. There are differences in the architecture specific
ABI on some architectures. Having the symlinks managed by alternatives
doesn't allow reliable builds with the same major/minor version of the
compiler.

Feedback appreciated
