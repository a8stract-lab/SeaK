It would be useful for most users to be familiar with policycoreutils
tools in order to manipulate policies installed on the
system. Specifically, it is useful to be familiar with:
 semodule(8)    - Manage SELinux policy modules.

By default, most modules are enabled after installing the selinux
policy packages, only some modules which are normally not used on debian
systems (for example other distribution's package managers) are disabled.
If you want to get rid of certain modules (for example to get a least
privilege system), you can disable them using "semodule -d", which will
be preserved during policy package upgrades. In contrast, if you remove
modules via "semodule -r", they will be re-added when the policy package
is upgraded.
