README for the debian-ports-archive-keyring package
===================================================

The debian-ports archive digitally signs its Release files that are
stored on the debian-ports.org ftp-server and its mirrors with the
keys contained in this package.

Each active key is provided in a separate keyring in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
as conffiles.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
here: http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt
