+ *       dest.
+ *
+ * stpcpy differs from strcpy in a key way: the return value is the new
+ * %NUL-terminated character. (for strcpy, the return value is a pointer to
+ * src. This interface is considered unsafe as it doesn't perform bounds
+ * checking of the inputs. As such it's not recommended for usage. Instead,
+ * its definition is provided in case the compiler lowers other libcalls to
+ * stpcpy.
